## Solution
This can be done easily by counting the factors of $n$ which are less than it and also be done by counting all factors including itself and subtracting 1. And the fastest method for it involves the use of prime numbers.
```pseudo
	\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Fafa and his Company}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\Procedure{FafaCompany}{$n$}
			\State $res \gets 1$
			\State $p \gets 2$
			\While{$p*p \leq n$}
				\State $c \gets 1$
				\While{$n \bmod p == 0$}
					\State $c \gets c+1$
					\State $n \gets \dfrac{n}{p}$
				\EndWhile
				\State $res \gets res*c$
				\State $p \gets p+1$
			\EndWhile
			\If{$n>1$}
				\State $res \gets res*2$
			\Endif
			\Return $res-1$
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
```
### Analysis
Here we are taking constant space and the time required is when the worst case happens and that is when n is prime and in that case we need $\sqrt{n}$ iterations of the loop, $\therefore$ $T(n)=O(\sqrt{n})$, $M(n)=O(1)$.
