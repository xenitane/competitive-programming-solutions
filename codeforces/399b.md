## Solution
So to approach this problem we can see that what we need is to count the length of segments of blue balls and check for a pattern. Let's see the pattern

| Initial State | Transformations                                             | Number of steps | 
|:-------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------- |:---------------:|
|       B       | B --> R                                                     |        1        |
|      BB       | BB --> BR --> RB --> RR                                     |        3        |
|      BBB      | BBB --> BBR --> BRB --> BRR --> RBB --> RBR --> RRB --> RRR |        7        |
and so on, and the pattern that emerges here is that if the length of the blue segment is $l$ the number of steps it takes is $2^{l}-1$. But what happens if there are red balls on top of blue balls.

| Initial State | Transformations                                       | Number of steps |
|:-------------:|:---------------------------------------------------- |:---------------:|
|       B       | B --> R                                              |        1        |
|      BR       | BR --> RB --> RR                                     |        2        |
|      BRR      | BRR --> RBB --> RBR --> RRB --> RRR                  |        4        |
|      BBR      | BBR --> BRB --> BRR ---> RBB --> RBR --> RRB --> RRR |        6        |
And if there are $k$ red balls in front of the balls, the result just multiplies by $2^k$

So in conclusion we can say that for any segment of blue balls of length $l$ that has $k$ balls ahead of it (irrespective of their initial color, cause they'll all be red eventually) takes this many steps: $(2^l-1)*2^k$. So we can just iterate over the red blue ball string and get out answer.
But there's more we can see from there that if we convert the stack into a binary number by replacing $R$ by $0$ and $B$ by $1$, we'll also get the answer.
```pseudo
	\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Blue and Red Balls}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\Procedure{RedAndBlueBalls}{$str,n$}
			\State $res \gets 0$
			\For{$i \gets 0$ \To $n-1$}
				\State $res \gets res*2$
				\If{$str_{i} == \text{ 'B'}$}
					\State $res \gets res+1$
				\EndIf
			\EndFor
			\State $res$
			\Return $res$
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
```
The above approach takes linear time to evaluate the result and the calculation of the exponent of 2 can be done just by using bit-shifting in constant time.
$\therefore T(n)=O(n)\text{ and }M(n)=O(1)$.
